• When I faced the problem of extremely non-optimized schedule in the first weeks of each term in KSE I have decided to create this program.
• The program takes an Excel file with the disciplines of each and every group and year of study, extracts the subjects that the user inputs, and outputs a new Excel file with the personalized schedule.

# Key libraries of the program:
• Tkinter
• CustomTkinter
• Pandas
• OS
• Warnings
• Numpy
• Colorama
